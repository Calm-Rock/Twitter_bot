# Twitter_bot
This repository contains the code of a simple twitter bot that I learned while learning about the flask framework. The description of what the bot does could be found in the <code>bot_script.py</code> file itself.
Just put in the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret which you'll get after making a tweeter developers account. 
What the bot does is that it searches out for the "search" parameter (line 21) and comments out the phrase written in the "phrase" parameter  (line 35) in the first 5 tweets of the search results.
We can seleect the number of tweets we want to comment on by cahnging the "NumberOfTweets" parameter (line 22)
